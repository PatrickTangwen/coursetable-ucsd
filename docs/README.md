## Historical SunGrid Records

These documents retain accepted constraints or pre-launch evidence, but they are
not the current operating source of truth.

- `cloudflare_hosted_staging.md`: accepted first-hosted-staging boundary,
  external state services, security, and cost policies.
- `cloudflare_production_readiness-2026-07-13.md`: code-only Production contract
  and pre-launch provisioning gates; superseded for deployed state and current
  operations by `cloudflare_production_operations-2026-07-14.md`.

## Inherited CourseTable References

These documents are retained for historical comparison and audit. They describe
upstream CourseTable systems and are not current SunGrid operating runbooks.

- `api.md`: inherited CourseTable API reference, including legacy challenge and
  evaluation-access endpoints; do not treat it as the hosted SunGrid API
  contract.
- `containers.md`: inherited CourseTable container and database architecture.
  The SunGrid boundary and UCSD adaptation are tracked by GitHub issues #87 and
  #88-#96.
- `graphql.md`: inherited Ferry/Hasura GraphQL integration. The planned UCSD
  Course Data Platform remains a shadow data path until its parity work is
  complete.
- `deployment.md`: inherited `coursetable.com`, Doppler, and self-hosted runner
  deployment notes; do not use it to deploy SunGrid.
- `maintenance.md`: inherited CourseTable/Ferry season-maintenance steps; do not
  use it as the SunGrid Production runbook.
- `challenge.md`: inherited CourseTable challenge/context notes.
- `locations.md`: inherited Yale building-coordinate and walking-time workflow.

## Planning And Decisions

- `planning/README.md`: planning archive index and guidance for where current
  planning work now lives.
- `adr/README.md`: decision-record index and ADR editing rules.
